A simple HTML templating language for Crystal

Important! Crystal has this built in, look here for more info: https://github.com/manastech/crystal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#020-2014-06-24

It uses the same syntax as ERB in ruby, cannot execute code in the view (yet). 
All variables must be in the locals hash and the value of the key replaces the code in the view.

See the example project in ./example for more information.
